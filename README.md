## What is ChessLM?

ChessLM is an advanced interactive chess platform that integrates multiple Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities. Unlike traditional chess interfaces, ChessLM allows you to:

* **Configure White and Black players independently** - choose Human or AI for each side
* **Support multiple AI providers** - Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, Mistral, and Ollama
* **Play moves** directly on an interactive chessboard with automatic AI turn execution
* **Chat with AI agents** via text messages, exploring their strategic reasoning in real-time
* **View transparent analysis** and tactical insights during gameplay

## Key Features üöÄ

* **Dual Player Configuration:** Set White and Black players independently - Human, AI, or mixed combinations
* **Multiple AI Providers:**
  - **Anthropic** (Claude models)
  - **OpenAI** (GPT models)
  - **Google Gemini** (Gemini models)
  - **Mistral** (Mistral models)
  - **Ollama** (Local models)
* **Automatic AI Gameplay:** AI agents play moves automatically without manual intervention
* **Interactive Chessboard:** Make moves or set custom positions seamlessly
* **Real-time Chat Interface:** Communicate with AI agents during gameplay
* **Transparent Reasoning:** View step-by-step position analysis and internal AI reasoning
* **Environment Configuration:** Secure API key management via .env files

## How Does it Work? üß†

ChessLM leverages advanced integrations and tools:

* [**Custom Gradio Component:**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Agents-MCP-Hackathon/gradio_chessboard) Interactive chessboard interface implemented as a custom Gradio component for seamless board-LLM interaction
* **Multi-Provider Architecture:** Supports multiple LLM providers with automatic model routing and API key management
* **UCI Move Format:** Ensures consistent move notation across all AI providers for reliable gameplay
* **Automatic Turn Management:** AI vs AI games progress automatically with configurable move limits

These integrations compensate for LLMs' typical limitations in chess-playing ability, ensuring accurate and meaningful gameplay analysis.

## Use Cases

* **AI vs AI Analysis:** Watch different language models compete and analyze their strategic approaches
* **Educational Tool:** Learn chess strategies through transparent AI reasoning and position analysis
* **Mixed Play Modes:** Human vs AI with choice of opponent strength and model provider
* **Research Platform:** Compare chess-playing capabilities across different LLM providers
* **Interactive Chess Assistant:** Get real-time analysis and explanations during gameplay
